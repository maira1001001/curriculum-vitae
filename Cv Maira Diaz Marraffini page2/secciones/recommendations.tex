\textit{I first knew Maira as a student in my elective course on programming at UNLP. At that moment she was also a member of the Student Union, very concerned with the teaching of Technology in general and Computer Science in particular to groups with adverse conditions. Knowing her interests, after passing my course, I invited her to work as teacher assistant in a course for introduction to programming at UNQ, where she worked for 3 consecutive semesters.
Maira is extremely resourceful and very concerned about her own performance. She is an excellent partner, working in groups with ease, and both leading and following others lead according to the needs of the situation. She is dedicated to her assignments, and deeply motivated to achieve good solutions.
I was very sad when Maira told me that she will be leaving UNQ to pursue other interests in developing systems and adquiring richer experiences on programming. I am sure any employers will be extremely satisfed having Maira in their teams. I strongly recommend her.}
